PyTorch tensors and their associated operations are very similar to NumPy n-dimensional arrays.

Package	Description
torch	The top-level PyTorch package and tensor library.
torch.nn	A subpackage that contains modules and extensible classes for building neural networks.
torch.autograd	A subpackage that supports all the differentiable Tensor operations in PyTorch.
torch.nn.functional	A functional interface that contains typical operations used for building neural networks like loss functions, activation functions, and convolution operations.
torch.optim	A subpackage that contains standard optimization operations like SGD and Adam.
torch.utils	A subpackage that contains utility classes like data sets and data loaders that make data preprocessing easier.
torchvision	A package that provides access to popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision.

 PyTorch uses a computational graph that is called a dynamic computational graph. This means that the graph is generated on the fly as the operations are created.
